shire
=====

`shire`  is a web framework based on Tornado and MongoDB.

Why choose Tonado Web and MongoDB?

As this [slide share](http://www.slideshare.net/ikailan/rapid-web-development-using-tornado-web-and-mongodb) shows,
for joy and freedom.

`shire` also arms with bootstrap and jinja2, so it's powerful.
But it is small and flexible enough to do any customization based on it.

`shire` is designed for developers to quickly implement a website and prevent from
wasting time on undertaking considerable basic jobs like configing db,
adding bootstrap, user administration, signin, sign out, uploading resources etc.

Tinker it as you like!
