shire
=====

`shire` is a web framework based on tornado and mongo.
It arms with bootstrap and jinja2, so it's powerful.
But it is small and flexible enough to do any customization based on it.

It is designed for developers to quickly implement a website and prevent
from wasting time on undertaking considerable basic jobs like configing db,
adding bootstrap etc.

Tinker it as you like!
